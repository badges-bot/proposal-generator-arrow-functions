# ECMAScript proposal: Generator Arrow Functions

**Authors**: TBA

**Champion**: TBA

**Stage**: Stage 1 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

## Motivation

> Experience so far has been that people love arrow functions and generators and want a generator arrow.
> â€” Brendan Eich

Both [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) are available since ES2015. Often people want to use generator arrow and this proposal (which was raised years ago) should solve their needs.

## Use cases

- [3 years old React example](https://gist.github.com/threepointone/014954c9270749d0b1d1051c12a705af)
- need more [use-cases](https://github.com/chicoxyzzy/proposal-generator-arrow-functions/issues/1)

## Possible solutions

```js
// Irregular
() =*> ...

// not the same order as in regular generator functions
() =>* ...

// also wrong order
() *=> ...

// ASI hazard
*() => ...
```
